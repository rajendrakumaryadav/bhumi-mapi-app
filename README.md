# Bhumi Mapi – Website

A simple, static landing site for the **Bhumi Mapi (भूमि मापी) – Land Area Calculator**
Android app. Built with **Vite + React + Tailwind CSS** and deployed as static files.

All download links point to the Google Play Store listing for the
package `io.github.rajendrakumaryadav.uprevenueconvertor`. Source code and
issue tracking live at <https://github.com/rajendrakumaryadav/bhumi-maapi>.

## Pages

- `/` – Landing page (hero, features, supported units, quick reference, download CTA, plus a working **live conversion demo** of the app's calculator)
- `/privacy` – Privacy policy (derived from the app's `AndroidManifest.xml`: zero permissions, zero network, zero data collection)

## Local development

```bash
cd website
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
```

## Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

This runs `vite build` and then `node scripts/postbuild.js`, which:

1. Generates `dist/404.html` using the [rafgraph SPA-for-GitHub-Pages
   technique](https://github.com/rafgraph/spa-github-pages) so deep links
   like `/land-area-calculator/privacy` work on direct visit. The
   `pathSegmentsToKeep` value is derived automatically from Vite's
   `<base href>` so it tracks the `BASE_PATH` config.
2. Verifies that the built asset paths sit under the configured base.
   If the build is stale (wrong subpath), `postbuild` exits non-zero
   with a clear error message.

```bash
npm run preview  # serves the built dist/ locally
```

## Deploying to GitHub Pages (project site)

This site is configured to live at
`https://rajendrakumaryadav.github.io/land-area-calculator/`.

- `vite.config.js` sets `base: '/land-area-calculator/'` so all built asset
  paths (`/assets/index-*.js`, `/assets/index-*.css`, etc.) resolve correctly
  under the subpath. **This is the fix for the "404 on `/*.js` and `/*.css`" issue.**
- `main.jsx` wraps the app in `<BrowserRouter basename="…">` so the React
  routes (`/`, `/privacy`) also resolve under the subpath.
- `scripts/postbuild.js` creates `dist/404.html` as a copy of `dist/index.html`.
  GitHub Pages serves `404.html` for any unknown path, which lets the React
  Router take over and render the correct page on direct visits to e.g.
  `…/land-area-calculator/privacy`.
- `public/.nojekyll` tells GitHub Pages to skip Jekyll processing, which would
  otherwise ignore files starting with `_` and strip `.nojekyll` itself.

### One-time setup

1. In your GitHub repo → **Settings → Pages**, set the source to
   **GitHub Actions** (recommended) or the `gh-pages` branch.
2. The simplest publish flow is the official GitHub Actions workflow
   [`actions/deploy-pages`](https://github.com/actions/deploy-pages) — drop
   this in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` at the repo root:

   ```yaml
   name: Deploy website
   on:
     push:
       branches: [main]
       paths: ['website/**']
   permissions:
     pages: write
     id-token: write
   jobs:
     build-deploy:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       environment:
         name: github-pages
         url: ${{ steps.deploy.outputs.page_url }}
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
         - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
           with: { node-version: 20 }
         - run: npm ci
           working-directory: website
         - run: npm run build
           working-directory: website
         - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
           with:
             path: website/dist
         - id: deploy
           uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
   ```

3. Push. After a minute the site will be live at
   `https://rajendrakumaryadav.github.io/land-area-calculator/`.

### Deploying under a different subpath

Set the `BASE_PATH` environment variable at build time:

```bash
BASE_PATH=/my-other-folder/ npm run build
```

The build, basename, and 404.html all pick up the new path automatically.

## Troubleshooting

### "Menus navigate to `…/privacy` instead of `…/land-area-calculator/privacy`"

This means the React Router `<BrowserRouter basename>` ended up empty.
It happens when the build is older than the `base` config in
`vite.config.js`. Fix:

```bash
cd website
rm -rf dist node_modules/.vite
npm run build
```

The `postbuild` hook will print `postbuild: asset paths OK` if the
base is correct, or `VERIFICATION FAILED` with the bad paths if not.

### "Network tab shows 404s for `/assets/index-*.js` and `/assets/index-*.css`"

Same root cause — the bundle was built without the `/land-area-calculator/`
prefix. Rebuild as above.

### "Direct visit to `/land-area-calculator/privacy` shows a 404"

The site uses the [rafgraph SPA-for-GH-Pages](https://github.com/rafgraph/spa-github-pages)
technique: `dist/404.html` encodes the original path in `?p=/…` and
redirects to the site root, and a small inline script in `index.html`
rewrites the URL back to the deep link before React Router boots.

If you end up at `https://…/?p=/land-area-calculator/privacy` (note the
`/?p=` — no subpath), the deployed `404.html` has `pathSegmentsToKeep = 0`,
which makes the redirect go to the GH Pages **user-site root** instead of
the project subpath. This almost always means a stale build was
deployed. Verify with:

```bash
npm run verify-deploy
```

Expected output:

```
Verifying deploy at https://rajendrakumaryadav.github.io/land-area-calculator/

  pathSegmentsToKeep in deployed 404.html: 1
  ✓ deployment looks correct (pathSegmentsToKeep=1)
```

If it prints `pathSegmentsToKeep=0` instead, rebuild and redeploy:

```bash
rm -rf dist node_modules/.vite
npm run build
# postbuild should print:
#   postbuild:
#     expected base : /land-area-calculator/
#     built base    : /land-area-calculator/
#     ✓ wrote 404.html  (pathSegmentsToKeep=1)
#     ✓ asset paths OK (2 checked)

# then redeploy the contents of dist/  (and ensure 404.html is included)
npm run verify-deploy
```

## Editing copy

All user-facing text lives in `src/data/content.js`. Edit it there and both the
landing page and the privacy page pick up the new values.

## Adding new routes

1. Add a page under `src/pages/`.
2. Register it in `src/App.jsx` inside `<Routes>`.

## Design notes

- Tailwind theme is extended with a `brand` (emerald/green) and `harvest` (amber)
  palette to match the Android app's agricultural theme.
- Hindi/English bilingual labels are used for the app name and key CTAs.
- No tracking, no analytics, no external scripts on this site either.
